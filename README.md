# UI/UX Design Challenge

We have 3 types of projects for our UI/UX designer. Branding, Website design, and application design. To be successful in the role, you’ll need to demonstrate your ability to complete the tasks. For this design challenge, we’ll only require you to complete one of the three (we hate the fact that we have to get you to do anything at all, and we absolutely refuse to make someone do THREE).

Brief
Chris Belle is a successful real estate agent who has decided to leave Image Property, and start his own brand. Image Property has been kind enough to let him keep his logo they made for him, but he must change his primary brand colour to a shade of green. His current agent page can be viewed here: https://imageproperty.com.au/christopher-bell/

All images on this page can be used in his new website.

Assuming we’ve completed a scoping session with Chris, we’ve attained the following notes:
* Chris’ target market is Brisbane house sales. 
* He won’t have a rent roll (so rentals aren’t needed to be shown)
* He uses a service called “Rate My Agent”, which has lots of his reviews, he’d like to show his success on this new site by using this service
* The most important thing is to get leads by getting clients to send him details. Getting an appraisal to sell a house is a good way to get leads, so he’d like to lead potential clients to contact him to get an appraisal.
* The images for his properties aren’t the greatest, so he’d like to know how to make these more consistent.
* He has a blog that he’d like to showcase, but it’s not super important.
* He has Instagram and Facebook
* The majority of the traffic to his current page is mobile
* His clients love to see their property on his website, and 90% of these people use desktop


Based on the above information, summarise your process highlighting how you would take the information from the scoping session, and use it to create a high fidelity, pixel perfect mockup, which well then be presented to the client for approval, and eventual handover to our developers.

Hint: The skills we’re looking for here, are communication, attention to detail, your thought process on what the user experience should be, a layout showcasing the user interface to maximise lead conversions based on Chris’ needs, and also your ability to use your chosen design tool. 

Minimum submission should be a paragraph explaining your choices, and a single screen view of a mockup, all the way up to a full scope/report, and a home page mockup. We completely understand that the latter can take a while, so we don’t expect it, but it’s entirely up to you.
